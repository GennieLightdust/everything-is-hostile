=============================
WorldGen Altering Mods First:

    Realistic Worldgen Mod - http://minecraft-forum.net/minecraft-mods-downloads/1-7-10-realistic-world-gen-mod-download/#.VNpjA_ldXpA
    

Non Worldgen Altering Mods:
    Thaumic energistics
    
    Thaumcraft NEI plugin - because the thaumomicon for playability improvement
    
    fastcraft+optifine+liteloader, or at least a pack varient ala Slopey style
    
    enchiridion - because too many damn books/manuals
    
    open blocks with graves
    
    Ae2stuff - because the crystal growing method of stock AE2 is gimmicky and this addresses that
    
    Infernal Mobs - you wanted it harder right? >:P
    
    Ztones - minus the functional blocks because they look awesome
    
    HQM, because this opens up a ton of gating and questing options for us to really add flavor to the pack
